Monadic-style Async, Maybe, Multi (List), Result (Either) computation pipelines for Java

## Learn what a Monad is by implementing them in an unsophisticated statically-typed language.

The approach we are taking here is a pragmattic one where we develop a number of Mands from the ground up, each to achieve a specific computational abstraction.

The Monad'ness shared by all the examples is demonstrated by putting them all into the same form which can be used in a single common way.
