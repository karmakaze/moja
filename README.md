Monadic-style Async, Maybe, Multi (List), Result (Either) computation pipelines for Java

## Learn what a Monad is by implementing them in an unsophisticated statically-typed language.

The approach we are taking here is a pragmattic one where we develop a number of Monads from the ground up, each to achieve a specific computational abstraction.
